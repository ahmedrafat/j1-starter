                                        Jekyll One Starter. This theme gives web developers and
                                        hobbyists a clean implementation in Jekyll for starting
                                        new projects and combines the best of open source software
                                        for the Web. Jekyll One is open source and the modules packed
                                        as well. No pain for private or professional purposes.

                                        until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element.
                                        These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
                                        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
                                        It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>,
                                        though the transition does limit overflow.
